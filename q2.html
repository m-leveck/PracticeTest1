        <h1>The Differences Between Google Docs and an HTML Document</h1>
        <h3>Features of Google Docs</h3>
            <p>Google docs has a very intuitive interface with drag and drop options, formatting tools, and pre-determined layout settings. There are lots of buttons and clear labels that a novice user could quickly understand. There are no technical skills required in Google Docs. It is designed to be accessible to anyone and has a very shallow learning curve. </p>
        <h3>Features of HTML Documents</h3>
            <p>In HTML the user is in charge of designing the layout, style, and content. Therefore, it is much more customizable than Google Docs. HTML gives the user a blank space to customize into whatever they please. HTML is optimal for structuring web browsers however it requires much more technical skills. There is a steeper learning curve to HTML but once you get the hang of it, it is not as daunting as it may seem. </p>
